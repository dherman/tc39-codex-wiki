# ECMAScript Wiki

This is the new home of the ECMAScript Wiki, where TC39 works on draft proposals and explanations of ECMAScript Edition 6.

## Public site

The public site will temporarily be at [tc39.github.com/wiki](http://tc39.github.com/wiki). Once it stabilizes, it will replace the official wiki at [wiki.ecmascript.org](http://wiki.ecmascript.org).

## Building locally

You can build and serve the wiki locally by running

```
$ node lib/wiki.js -p port
```

By default the wiki serves on port 8888.

(Directory watching is not yet stable so it's not enabled. It'll be enabled once the code stabilizes.)
