        <article><h1>The Harmony Process</h1>
<p>&quot;Harmony&quot; is the name TC39 uses for our standardization process. The process is simple but has been effective for making progress on design and consensus-building.

</p>
<h2>Proposals</h2>
<p>Proposals go through several steps before becoming part of a standard.

</p>
<h3>Sketch</h3>
<p>Proposals start out in the form of <a href="/sketches">feature sketches</a> (committee members typically refer to these as &quot;strawman proposals&quot; or &quot;strawmen&quot;). Feature sketches can be added at any time. They often arise from suggestions from the developer community.

</p>
<h3>Proposal</h3>
<p>When TC39 agrees that a feature is important and promising enough to consider for inclusion in the next edition of the standard, it gets promoted to official proposal status (often referred to as &quot;achieving Harmony&quot; or having &quot;Harmony status&quot;). Reaching proposal status is <em>not</em> a guarantee that a feature will be included, but it indicates a higher degree of confidence.

</p>
<p>TC39 sets a deadline for accepting proposals for a given edition. The deadline for <a href="/es6">ES6 proposals</a> was May, 2011; no new major proposals are being considered for ES6.

</p>
<h3>Standard</h3>
<p>Finally, a proposal becomes an official feature of ECMAScript when it is included in an edition of the ECMAScript standard. TC39 aims to have at least two interoperable, production-quality implementations of a feature in major JavaScript engines before accepting it to the final standard.

</p>
<h2>Champions</h2>
<p>Because TC39 has a reasonably large number of <a href="/about/people">participants</a>, it&#39;s not feasible to do collaborative design work with the whole committee. Instead, each proposal is shepherded by a small sub-group of &quot;champions&quot; (usually just 1 or 2 committee members). The champions do the design work for the proposal independently and report back to TC39 in face-to-face meetings and on <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/es-discuss">es-discuss</a>.
